## Dont use this thing, this is only a POC ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢

### Install stuff

```
npm install

```


### Run for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Edit your template

The template should be located on the `code/template` folder, this is hardcoded so dont be creative about it.

you can see how your template is working on `localhost:3000`, then you only need to create a zipfile of the `code/template` folder and upload it to wordpress
